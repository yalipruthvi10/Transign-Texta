# Transign-Texta
TransignTexta empowers the deaf and mute community by giving their hands a voice â€” literally transforming gestures into words. This helps eliminate communication barriers in public spaces, schools, workplaces, and daily life.
This project aims to bridge the communication gap between the deaf/mute community and the general population by converting sign language gestures into readable text. By providing real-time gesture-to-text translation, the system helps improve accessibility in education, workplaces, healthcare, and daily interactions.
